# Lists and Boxes :

lists allow us to group a set of related items in lists,An unordered list starts with the `<ul>` tag. Each list item starts with the `<li>` tag. ordered list starts with the `<ol>` tag. Each list item starts with the `<li>` tag description lists.

A description list is a list of terms, with a description of each term.The `<dl>` tag defines the description list, the `<dt>` tag defines the term (name), and the `<dd>` tag describes each term.

# Boxes

Every box has three available properties that can be adjusted to control its appearance ,The padding and margin properties are very helpful in adding space between various items on the page, Border every box has a border (even if it is not visible or is specified to be 0 pixels wide). The border
separates the edge of one box from another.
