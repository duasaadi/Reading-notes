Today we recape the information about the html which is a markdown language 
and  css which is style language and js which a programming one.

In html page we have head and body, inside the head we put the tiltle for the
 page and we link css page or just write its artibutes that give the html sheet 
 its style, like color, font and such.we start styling with <style> tag. 

the body consists of : header , main and footer .
Inside the bodywe write the ordered and the unordered lists by using their thage
 with <li> tag , we can add also images inside header tag by using <a> tag, links
  and any other additions. we use also some tags just to organize the html page as a developer like nav tag .
 we use <h1 -h2 -h3-h4-h5-h6> tags which reflect the importance of the sentences respectivly.
 we use the footer to put what we want to display at the bottom of the webpag
  and to link js file or just wtite its instructions by using <script>
tag to make the page more dynamic and interactive. we can build functions, loops, if statement and other codes.
