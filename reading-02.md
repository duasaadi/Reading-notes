# Text with HTML 
 we have several elements in html to embed text ,headin wich allocates from 1 to 6,and `<p>` contains several lines and some tags could sorround specific words to make it bold lik `<b>`
 or italic like `<i>`,`<br/>`takes you to a new line and `<hr/>` makes a space between paragraphs.


 # CSS
Css is responsible on your Htmls elements' appearance ,and the designe and layout all about the shape of your web page,it made up of selectors ,and declaration that declares features,Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties of the element that you want to change, and the values of those properties. For example, the font-family property sets the choice of font, and the value arial specifies Arial as the preferred typeface

# Java Script
the code container which is responsible of the interactivity of web page and can make more user fraiendly .
 **declaring variable**
 * var name = information; | here we have variable which named `name` and has a value of ` information`
-------------------------- | -----------------------------------------------------------
we could include several data types into a variable the most used are numbers which are the usual numeric mathematical ones, and string data type which contains charecters and letters ,and boolean tht has one of two values true or false.more over if you want to change the type of the variable just remention it's nme after declaring it an equal it wit the new data type.

## if condition 
we use if statements in order to have deffernt out put for diversity of input , if statement evaluate a condition or  situation ,and if the out put meet it a seriese of commands would be applied and excuted and if it's not met another series of commands would be excuted 
 if (condition){
the lines and code that excuted if the condition is met
 } if else {
     lines of code excuted if the condition did not be met
 }
 in condition we either put comparison operators or logical ones or we can use both.
