# Problem Domain :
*What is the hardest thing about writing code?*
* Learning a new technology
* Naming things
* Testing your code
* Debugging
* Fixing bugs
* Making software maintainable

 Writing code is a lot like putting together a jigsaw puzzle.  We put together code with the purpose of building components that we have taken out of the “bigger picture” of the problem domain.The big issue is that many problem domains are like a puzzle with a blurry picture or no picture at all.
 **Many of the problem domains we face as programmers are difficult to understand and look completely different depending on your viewpoin**
 In any project you should take  the time to clearly understand the problem domain before writing any code.You can often make the problem domain easier by cutting out cases and narrowing your focus to a particular part of the problem.

 # Objects:
 Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object, variables and functions take on new names. varables become **properties** and functions bacome **methods**
 creating an object by Lateral notation method :

 you can access the propertie using dot notation and this goes with methods also

 # DOM:
 The DOM defines a standard for accessing documents.
 With the object model, JavaScript gets all the power it needs to create dynamic HTML:

* JavaScript can change all the HTML elements in the page
* JavaScript can change all the HTML attributes in the page
* JavaScript can change all the CSS styles in the page
* JavaScript can remove existing HTML elements and attributes
* JavaScript can add new HTML elements and attributes
* JavaScript can react to all existing HTML events in the page
* JavaScript can create new HTML events in the page

The HTML DOM is a standard object model and programming interface for HTML. It defines:

* The HTML elements as objects
* The properties of all HTML elements
* The methods to access all HTML elements
* The events for all HTML elements
* In other words: The HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements.
