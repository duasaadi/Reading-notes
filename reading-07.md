# Tables:
Tables include information in a grid formate ,to formate a table in HTML code there are several tags :
* `<table>` tag used to create a table
* `<tr>` tag to start a raw
* `<td>` for each cell
* `<th>` tag to represent heading cells
However, For long tables you can split the table into a `<thead>`,`<tbody>`, and `<tfoot>`.

# Objects :
to add a new object you can add the name of it followed by `new object();` key word and then with dot notation you can add properties and methods  to your blank object this  method called **constructor notation**
sometimes you need to create several objects with similar properties or methods so you can use a function as a template to create objects .

Arrays are special type of objects ,hold data pairs but the paring is between data values and index,so we can combine objecta with arrays to store series of objects and create complex data structure , and vise versa objects also can hold arrays.

# Built in objects:
Browsers come with a set of built-in objects that represent things like the browser window and the current web page shown in that window. These built-in objects act like a toolkit for creating interactive web pages.
